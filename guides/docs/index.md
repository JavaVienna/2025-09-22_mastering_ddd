# About this workshop

This workshop will explore Domain-Driven Design (DDD) through practical actions when developing Java solutions.

We will begin with the **strategic perspective**, covering essential concepts such as **domains and subdomains, ubiquitous language, bounded contexts, and context mapping**. These foundations will help us understand how to align software models with business needs and design systems that evolve with clarity.

From there, we move into the **tactical building blocks**—including **entities, value objects, aggregates, repositories, factories, domain services, domain events, and application services**—to see how business rules are modeled directly in code.

We will also explore how DDD fits into **layered architecture** (presentation, application, domain, and infrastructure) and connect it with the persistence layer using **Jakarta EE, Jakarta Data, and Jakarta NoSQL**.

Hands-on labs will guide us through implementing these concepts step by step, applying DDD patterns in real Java code to reinforce both theory and practice.

## What we will learn

This workshop will provide a clear understanding of how Domain-Driven Design (DDD) guides both the **strategic** and **tactical** aspects of software design. Participants will learn how to connect business language to code and how to implement domain models effectively in Java. By combining theory with hands-on coding, you will see how DDD patterns translate directly into maintainable and scalable applications.

## Objectives

- Understand the difference between **strategic DDD** (domains, subdomains, ubiquitous language, bounded contexts, context mapping) and **tactical DDD** (entities, value objects, aggregates, repositories, factories, domain services, domain events, and application services).
- Recognize how DDD fits into a **layered architecture** and supports clean separation of concerns.
- Explore how persistence can be handled using **Jakarta EE, Jakarta Data, and Jakarta NoSQL**.
- Apply DDD patterns step by step in **hands-on labs**, reinforcing theory through practice.

## Takeaways

By the end of the workshop, you will:
- Be able to identify and model business domains and subdomains.
- Use a **ubiquitous language** to improve communication between developers and domain experts.
- Implement DDD tactical patterns directly in Java with confidence.
- Understand how **layered architecture** supports DDD.
- Gain practical experience with persistence using **Jakarta EE and Jakarta NoSQL**.
- Walk away with code examples and labs you can adapt to your own projects.
