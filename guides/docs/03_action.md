# 3rd Action, the Movie: Establishing Boundaries and Context Mapping  

In this exercise you will see how the concepts of **bounded context** and **context mapping** can be applied in real life. 

!!! note "Roll up your sleeves, and get to action!"

    It's time to practice what you have learned and get your hands. Roll up your sleeves and let's get to action!

## Exercise goals

## Scenario

**Business Goal:** As a moviegoer, I want to go to the movie theater, buy a ticket, maybe get some snacks and drinks, and watch the chosen movie.

## Practicing Domain Storytelling
 
Use [Egon](https://egon.io/) to map this story while you explore it using Domain Storytelling.

The outcome of this practice should be a **diagram** representation of the **Movie** use case and its respective **java service**.

### Getting Started

!!! tip "TIP: Shedding light on solutions"

    ... 

1. Using your browser, access [Egon.io](http://egon.io)
2. Import the diagram located under `ddd-workshop-labs/storytelling/03-movies.dst`
3. Complete the domain by exploring the use case, asking questions or discussing with other attendees;

Make sure you complete the following tasks:

- [ ] Describe in the diagram, the `sequence order` of each action. 
    - _To change a group sequence, you can double-click on the association arrow and set your input data;_
- [ ] Are there optional items? Add a `text annotation` to highlight this characteristic.

- [ ] #WIP

Once you're satisfied with the domain map, and you feel like it covers the use case story accordingly, you are ready to
start designing you Java service.
 
Our next step is to practice the modeling of the application, matching the implementation with the domain exploration details.

## A Story becomes Code: Creating the Java service


1. In the `ddd-workshop-labs` folder, locate and open the project `03-movies` using your chosen Java IDE;

#WIP

Here are some examples and ideas to help you get started:
   

These insights should help you understand what are the expected classes to have, methods and associations.
