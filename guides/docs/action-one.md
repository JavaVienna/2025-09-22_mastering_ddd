## Action 1: Getting started with Domain Storytelling 

Using Domain Storytelling we will:

* explore a business problem and goal, describe a domain and understand how this is the

  first step into designing the respective Java solution.

* Understand the problem being solved and map it using Egon;

* Identify four core elements: **actors**, **work objects**, **activities** and **sequence numbers**.
