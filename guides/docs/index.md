# About this workshop

This workshop will unravel DDD into practical actions when developing Java solutions. 

We'll cover both strategy and tactics: 
We'll start a solution case from scratch and cover how several concepts, such as bounded context, context maps, and 
ubiquitous language, can be used efficiently. 

See why and how these practices can increase the chances of delivering a solution that correctly maps down 
different business needs and allows us to develop the best implementation strategies to reflect a business problem 
into a technical solution.

While getting our hands dirty in coding, we'll learn patterns such as entity, value object, repository, and
aggregator, applied to Java.
