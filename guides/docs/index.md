# About this workshop

This workshop will explore Domain-Driven Design (DDD) through practical actions when developing Java solutions.

We will begin with the **strategic perspective**, covering essential concepts such as **domains and subdomains, ubiquitous language, bounded contexts, and context mapping**. These foundations will help us understand how to align software models with business needs and design systems that evolve with clarity.

From there, we move into the **tactical building blocks**—including **entities, value objects, aggregates, repositories, factories, domain services, domain events, and application services**—to see how business rules are modeled directly in code.

We will also explore how DDD fits into **layered architecture** (presentation, application, domain, and infrastructure) and connect it with the persistence layer using **Jakarta EE, Jakarta Data, and Jakarta NoSQL**.

Hands-on labs will guide us through implementing these concepts step by step, applying DDD patterns in real Java code to reinforce both theory and practice.
